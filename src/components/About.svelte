      This website serves as an archive of the written work of the late Richard O'Ffill. The content comes from manuscripts that could be found on his personal computer, as well as what could be scraped from archived pages of revivalsermons.org. If you are not aware, revivalsermons.org was lost shortly after Richard O'Ffill's passing due to some technical issues. Losing the website to me felt like a part of his legacy was lost. Given that I am his grandson and a software engineer, I wanted to do what I could to keep as much of his content alive. With the help of Gaby Carcamo, this site was built in an attempt to do just that. It is a manual process to convert what he has written into something that can be displayed on a web page, so in my free time I am adding what I can to the site.
